## Part 1 - Architecture introduction
There are three mainly parts of Lutece:

    + [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as Javascript framework.
    + [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) as UI framework.

To easy start, we do not consider run local judge osiris core.

Run dev frontend server in localhost is quite easy, please follow the [README](https://github.com/lutece-awesome/lutece-frontend/blob/master/README.md).

Run dev backend server is more complexity, please follow these steps:
+ pip3 install -r requirements/requirements.txt
+ cp Lutece/config.py.tempalte Lutece/config.py
+ [make migrations](https://github.com/lutece-awesome/lutece-backend/blob/master/.travis.yml#L23)
+ [migrate](https://github.com/lutece-awesome/lutece-backend/blob/master/.travis.yml#L24)
+ python3 manage.py runserver
## Part 3 - Dev environment

+ Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Backend:
+ Use [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) professional version(if you are student, you can apply [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)).
